Changes of v0.40 to v0.42 (July 2017)

* Fixed a bug in the algorithm to mutate sequences that occurs when there is
  more than one SNP or indel.
 
* Added new options in the programs to control the printing of verbose and
  development info, and the making of statistical graphics.

We thank to the professor Alex Buerkle his comments to improve ddRADseqTools.
